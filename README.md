# dsa
A command-line utility for managing the learning of data structures and algorithms.

`dsa` uses the Free Spaced Repition Scheduleing algorithm, and 
`@Meeshbhoombah`'s public `DSA.md` checklist to provide a tracking system for 
progress made in learning and relearning key Data Structures and Algorithms in 
Computer Science.

## Features
- Spaced-repetition learning and relearning with Machine Learning
- Local storage with `sqlite3`
- Command-line interface
